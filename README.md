# Project "Mansion of Trepidation"
This is a choice-based solo fantasy adventure in the style of the 'Choose Your Own Adventure' and 'Fighting Fantasy' books developed in vanilla JavaScript, and using Bootstrap 5.

The art is generated using Midjourney and Bing Image Creator. I generated much of the text using Chat GPT. The sound effects are from http://freesound.org
